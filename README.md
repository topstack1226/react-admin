[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jekyll/jekyll-admin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jekyll/jekyll-admin)

A Jekyll plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Jekyll sites. The project is divided into two parts. A Ruby-based HTTP API that handles Jekyll and filesystem operations, and a Javascript-based front end, built on that API.
