# Jekyll::Admin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jekyll/jekyll-admin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jekyll/jekyll-admin)

A Jekyll plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Jekyll sites. The project is divided into two parts. A Ruby-based HTTP API that handles Jekyll and filesystem operations, and a Javascript-based front end, built on that API.

## Installation

Refer to [Install Plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#installing-a-plugin) in Jekyll docs and install the `jekyll-admin` plugin as you would normally by adding `jekyll-admin` to your Gemfile and `_config.yml`'s `gems` list.

## Usage

1. Start Jekyll as you would normally `bundle exec jekyll serve`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/admin` to access the administrative interface
